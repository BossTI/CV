		<h1>Life Is Never Balanced</h1>
		<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
</head>
		<p>Asah loves football just like most boys. He is from a wealthy home. While growing, his parents restricted him from going out to play with the other boys. He never had the exposure the other boys had but his parents made everything he wanted available for him. Asah's father, Mr Wells had built a mini pitch in the house where his son often trained. He had also hired a personal trainer for his son. Asah's goal was to be a professional footballer, he never took his eyes off his goal. He was always working, most times alone.</p>

		<p>He had more than enough resources to train with but lacked exposure. The other boys on the street had the exposure but never had enough resources to train with. The boys would often play handmade paper balls which they made themselves with paper and cellotape. Sometimes they would play plastic bottles as soccer ball and when they were fortunate enough, they played deflated balls.

		<p>The boys had access to the fields on the streets which had a standard goal size where they often practiced their shots, goalies practiced their goalkeeping. They played a lot of standard 11 v 11 matches against themselves which opened their awareness to the various positions on the field.</p>

		<p>
		The boys wish was to be blessed with so much resources as Asah possessed while Asah's wish was to be exposed like the other boys but even though they all felt like the grass was greener on the other side, they kept working with what they had. <b>They understood that it's okay to admit where one is lacking and crave all the good stuffs they wanted but it should'nt be ones excuse for not progressing.</b>
		</p>

		<p>Whatever it is you do, never dwell on the things that you don't have. Focus on getting the best out of what you have with progress as your primary goal. </p>
